* Third party integration with Expensify. 
* With Expensify, you can track expenses, submit reports, pay bills, generate invoices, and so much more all in one place.
* One can pull vendor info and expenses/payments/bills associated with these vendors from a third party system like expensify, and integrate with their own accounting system.
* This project demonstrates the above. It's a Spring Boot application that pulls data (vendors, vendor transactions) from Expensify, processes and persists the data to a MongoDB instance.
